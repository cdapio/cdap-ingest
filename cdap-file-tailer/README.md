# CDAP File Tailer

File Tailer is a daemon process that performs tailing of sets of local files. 
As soon as a new record has been appended to the end of a file that the daemon is monitoring, 
it sends it to a Stream via the CDAP REST API.

## Features

- distributed as debian and rpm packages;
- loads properties from a configuration file;
- supports rotation of log files;
- persists state and is able to resume from first unsent record; and
- dumps statistics info.

## Usage

To install File Tailer, execute one of these commands:
 
- on Debian/Ubuntu systems:

        sudo apt-get install cdap-file-tailer-1.0.1.deb

- on RHEL/CentOS systems:

        sudo rpm -ivh --force cdap-file-tailer-1.0.1.rpm

Repository information can be found at http://docs.cask.co/cdap/current/en/admin.html#packaging

Once installed, configure the daemon by editing the file:

    /etc/file-tailer/conf/file-tailer.properties

These parameters must be specified:

    pipes=<pipe1-name, pipe2-name, ... >
    pipes.<pipe1-name>.source.work_dir=<source-work-directory>
    pipes.<pipe1-name>.source.file_name=<source-file-name>
    pipes.<pipe1-name>.sink.stream_name=<stream-name>
    pipes.<pipe1-name>.sink.host=<host-name>
    pipes.<pipe1-name>.sink.port=<port-number>
    ...

Please note that the target file must be accessible to the File Tailer user.
To check, you can use the ```more``` command with the File Tailer user:

    sudo -u file-tailer more path_to_target_file

To start the daemon, execute the command:

    sudo service file-tailer start

To stop the daemon, execute the command:

    sudo service file-tailer stop

File Tailer stores log files in the ```/var/log/file-tailer``` directory.
PID, states and statistics are stored in the ```/var/run/file-tailer``` directory.
 
## Example Configuration

This configuration file will have the File Tailer application monitor two different directories for target log files.
Logs from each directory will be sent to two separate streams.

    # General pipe properties 
    # Comma-separated list of pipes to be configured
    pipes=app1pipe,app2pipe
    
    # Pipe 1 source properties
    # Working directory (where to monitor files)
    pipes.app1pipe.source.work_dir=/var/log/app1
    # Name of log file
    pipes.app1pipe.source.file_name=app1.log
    
    # Pipe 1 sink properties
    # Name of the stream
    pipes.app1pipe.sink.stream_name=app1Stream
    # Host name that is used by stream client
    pipes.app1pipe.sink.host=cdap_host.example.com
    # Host port that is used by stream client
    pipes.app1pipe.sink.port=10000

    # Pipe 2 source properties
    # Working directory (where to monitor files)
    pipes.app2pipe.source.work_dir=/var/log/app2
    # Name of log file
    pipes.app2pipe.source.file_name=app2.log

    # Pipe 2 sink properties
    # Name of the stream
    pipes.app2pipe.sink.stream_name=app1Stream
    # Host name that is used by stream client
    pipes.app2pipe.sink.host=cdap_host.example.com
    # Host port that is used by stream client
    pipes.app2pipe.sink.port=10000

## Authentication Client

Once File Tailer is installed, configure the Authentication Client by editing the properties file:

    /etc/file-tailer/conf/auth-client.properties

Authentication Client configuration parameters:

- ```pipes.<pipe-name>.sink.auth_client``` - classpath of authentication client class
- ```pipes.<pipe-name>.sink.auth_client_properties``` - path to authentication client properties file

### Authentication Client Example Configuration

    # User name
    security.auth.client.username=admin
    # User password
    security.auth.client.password=realtime
