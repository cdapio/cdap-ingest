# CDAP Stream Client for Java

The Stream Client Java API is for managing Streams from Java applications.

## Supported Actions

- Create a Stream
- Update TTL (time-to-live) for an existing Stream
- Retrieve the current Stream TTL
- Truncate an existing Stream (the deletion of all events that were written to the Stream)
- Write an event to an existing Stream

## Build

To build the Stream Client Java API jar, use:

    mvn clean package

## Usage

To use the Stream Client Java API, include this Maven dependency in your project's ```pom.xml``` file:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>co.cask.cdap</groupId>
      <artifactId>cdap-stream-client</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.1</version>
    </dependency>

## Example

### Create StreamClient

Create a StreamClient instance, specifying the fields 'host' and 'port' of the CDAP instance.

    StreamClient streamClient = new RestStreamClient.Builder("localhost", 10000).build();

Optional configurations that can be set (and their default values):

- ssl: false (set true to use HTTPS protocol)
- verifySSLCert: true (set false to suspend certificate checks; this allows self-signed certificates when SSL is true)
- authClient: null ([CDAP Authentication Client](https://github.com/caskdata/cdap-clients/tree/develop/cdap-authentication-clients/java)
  to interact with a secure CDAP instance)

Example:

    StreamClient streamClient = new RestStreamClient.Builder("localhost", 10000)
                                                    .ssl(true)
                                                    .authClient(authenticationClient)
                                                    .build();

### Create Stream

Create a new Stream with the *stream id* "streamName":

    streamClient.create("streamName");

**Notes:**

- The *stream-id* should only contain ASCII letters, digits and hyphens.
- If the Stream already exists, no error is returned, and the existing Stream remains in place.

### Create StreamWriter

Create a ```StreamWriter``` instance for writing events to the Stream *streamName*:

    StreamWriter streamWriter = streamClient.createWriter("streamName");

### Write Stream Events

To write new events to the Stream, use the ```StreamWriter``` interface:

    ListenableFuture<Void> future = streamWriter.write("New log event", Charsets.UTF_8);

### Truncate Stream

To delete all events that were written to the Stream *streamName*, use:

    streamClient.truncate("streamName");

### Update Stream Time-to-Live (TTL)

Update TTL for the Stream *streamName*:

    streamClient.setTTL("streamName", newTTL);

### Get Stream Time-to-Live (TTL)

Get the current TTL value for the Stream *streamName*:

    long ttl = streamClient.getTTL("streamName");

### Close Clients

When you are finished, release all resources by calling these two methods:

     streamWriter.close();
     streamClient.close();
