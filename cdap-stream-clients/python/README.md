# CDAP Stream Client for Python

The Stream Client Python API is for managing Streams from Python applications.

## Supported Actions

- Create a Stream
- Update TTL (time-to-live) for an existing Stream
- Retrieve the current Stream TTL
- Truncate an existing Stream (the deletion of all events that were written to the Stream)
- Write an event to an existing Stream


## Installation

To install CDAP Stream Client, run

    $ pip install cdap-stream-client


## Usage

To use the Stream Client Python API, include these imports in your Python script:

    from cdap_stream_client import Config
    from cdap_stream_client import StreamClient


## Example

### Create StreamClient

Create a StreamClient instance with default parameters.

    stream_client = StreamClient()

Optional configurations that can be set (and their default values):

- host: 'localhost'
- port: 10000
- ssl: False (set true to use HTTPS protocol)
- ssl_cert_check: True (set False to suspend certificate checks; this allows self-signed certificates when SSL is True)
- authClient: null ([CDAP Authentication Client](https://github.com/caskdata/cdap-clients/tree/develop/cdap-authentication-clients/python)
  to interact with a secure CDAP instance)

Example:

    config = Config()
    config.host = 'localhost'
    config.port = 10000
    config.ssl = True
    config.set_auth_client(authentication_client)

    stream_client = StreamClient(config)


### Create Stream

Create a new Stream with the *stream-id* "newStreamName":

    stream_client.create("newStreamName")

**Notes:**

- The *stream-id* should only contain ASCII letters, digits and hyphens.
- If the Stream already exists, no error is returned, and the existing Stream remains in place.

### Create StreamWriter

Create a ```StreamWriter``` instance for writing events to the Stream "streamName":

    stream_writer = stream_client.create_writer("streamName")

### Write Stream Events
To write new events to the Stream, use the ```write``` method of the ```StreamWriter``` class:

    def write(self, message, charset=None, headers=None)

Example:

    stream_promise = stream_writer.write("New stream event")

### Truncate Stream

To delete all events that were written to the Stream *streamName*, use:

    stream_client.truncate("streamName")

### Update Stream Time-to-Live (TTL)

Update TTL for the Stream *streamName*:

    stream_client.set_ttl("streamName", newTTL)

### Get Stream Time-to-Live (TTL)

Get the current TTL value for the Stream *streamName*:

    ttl = stream_client.get_ttl("streamName")

### StreamPromise

StreamPromise's goal is to implement deferred code execution.

For error handling, create a handler for each case and set it using the ```onResponse``` method. The error handling callback function is optional.

Example:

    def on_ok_response(response):
        ...
        parse response
        ...

    def on_error_response(response):
        ...
        parse response
        ...

    stream_promise = stream_writer.write("New stream event")
    stream_promise.on_response(on_ok_response, on_error_response)
