# CDAP Flume

The CDAP Sink is a Flume Sink implementation using REST Stream interface to write events received from a source.

## Usage

To use, put the CDAP Sink jar file in the Flume classpath (for example, in the Flume lib directory).
The JAR can be obtained from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|cdap-flume).
 
Specify the fully-qualified name of your CDAP Sink class in the Flume configuration properties:

    a1.sinks.sink1.type = co.cask.cdap.flume.StreamSink

Enter the host name that is used by the stream client:

    a1.sinks.sink1.host = <hostname or host ip>  

Target Stream name:

    a1.sinks.sink1.streamName = <Stream name>


Optional parameters that can be specified are listed below with their default values.

Enter the host port that is used by the Stream Client:

    a1.sinks.sink1.port = 10000

Secure Socket Layer mode [true | false]

    a1.sinks.sink1.sslEnabled = false

Verify SSL Certificate [true | false]
    
    a1.sinks.sink1.verifySSLCert = true
    # set it to false to suspend certificate checks; this allows self-signed certificates when SSL is true

Number of threads to which Stream Client can send events:

    a1.sinks.sink1.writerPoolSize = 10

CDAP Router server version:

    a1.sinks.sink1.version = v2


## Authentication Client

To use authentication, add these authentication client configuration parameters to the sink configuration file:

Fully qualified class name of the client class:

    a1.sinks.sink1.authClientClass = co.cask.cdap.security.authentication.client.basic.BasicAuthenticationClient

Path to authentication client properties file:

    a1.sinks.sink1.authClientProperties = /usr/local/apache-flume/conf/auth_client.conf    
     
### Authentication Client Example Configuration

    # User name
    security.auth.client.username=admin
    # User password
    security.auth.client.password=secret

## Example

Configuration of a Flume agent that reads data from a log file and puts it to CDAP using CDAP Sink.

    a1.sources = r1
    a1.channels = c1
    a1.sources.r1.type = exec
    a1.sources.r1.command = tail -F /tmp/log
    a1.sources.r1.channels = c1
    a1.sinks = k1
    a1.sinks.k1.type = co.cask.cdap.flume.StreamSink
    a1.sinks.k1.channel = c1
    a1.sinks.k1.host  = 127.0.0.1
    a1.sinks.k1.port = 10000
    a1.sinks.k1.streamName = logEventStream
    a1.channels.c1.type = memory
    a1.channels.c1.capacity = 1000
    a1.channels.c1.transactionCapacity = 100
