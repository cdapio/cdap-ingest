# CDAP File DropZone

File DropZone allows users to easily perform the bulk ingestion of local files.
Files can either be directly uploaded, or they can be copied to a *work_dir*, 
where they will automatically be ingested by a daemon process.

## Features

- Distributed as debian and rpm packages;
- Loads properties from a configuration file;
- Supports multiple observers/topics;
- Able to survive restart and resumes sending from the first unsent record of each of the existing files; and
- Removes files that are completely sent.

## Usage

To install File DropZone, execute one of these commands:
 
- on Debian/Ubuntu systems:

        sudo apt-get install cdap-file-drop-zone-1.0.1.deb

- on RHEL/CentOS systems:

        sudo rpm -ivh --force cdap-file-drop-zone-1.0.1.rpm

Repository information can be found at http://docs.cask.co/cdap/current/en/admin.html#packaging

Once installed, configure the daemon by editing the file:

    /etc/file-drop-zone/conf/file-drop-zone.properties

These parameters must be specified:

    polling_interval
    observers
    work_dir
    observers.obs1.pipe
    pipes.pipe1.sink.stream_name
    pipes.pipe1.sink.host
    pipes.pipe1.sink.port

To start the daemon, execute the command:

    sudo service file-drop-zone start

To stop the daemon, execute the command:

    sudo service file-drop-zone stop

File DropZone stores log files in the ```/var/log/file-drop-zone``` directory.
PID, states and statistics are stored in the ```/var/run/file-drop-zone``` directory

## Uploading A File Directly

To upload a file that is outside of the *work_dir*, execute the command:

    file-drop-zone load <file-path> <observer>

If only one observer is configured, the *observer* parameter is not required:

    file-drop-zone load <file-path>

## Authentication Client

Once File DropZone is installed, configure the Authentication Client by editing the properties file:

    /etc/file-drop-zone/conf/auth-client.properties

Authentication Client configuration parameters:

- ```pipes.<pipe-name>.sink.auth_client``` - classpath of authentication client class
- ```pipes.<pipe-name>.sink.auth_client_properties``` - path to authentication client properties file

### Authentication Client Example Configuration

    # User name
    security.auth.client.username=admin
    # User password
    security.auth.client.password=realtime

## Example Configuration

This configuration file will set the File DropZone application to observe 2 directories using 2 pipes:

    # Polling directories interval in milliseconds
    polling_interval=5000

    # Comma-separated list of directories observers to be configured
    observers=obs1

    #Path to work directory
    work_dir=/var/file-drop-zone/

    # General observer configurations
    # Pipe is used for loading data from the file to the Stream
    observers.obs1.pipe=pipe1

    # Pipe sink properties
    # Name of the stream
    pipes.pipe1.sink.stream_name=logEventStream
    # Host name that is used by stream client
    pipes.pipe1.sink.host=localhost
    # Host port that is used by stream client
    pipes.pipe1.sink.port=10000
    # Whether or not the sink endpoint uses SSL
    pipes.pipe1.sink.ssl=true
    # Whether or not the certificate should be checked if using SSL
    pipes.pipe1.sink.verify.ssl.cert=true
    # Path to authentication client properties to use if SSL is being used
    pipes.pipe1.sink.auth_client_properties=/etc/file-drop-zone/conf/auth-client.properties
